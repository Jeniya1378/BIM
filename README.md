## 🏡 Project 1: Dream House

**Objective:**  
Design a conceptual residential home model using Autodesk Revit.

**Highlights:**
- Custom floor plan design
- Elevations, sections, and 3D isometric views
- Wall, window, door, and roof component customization
- Interior layout visualization

**Skills Used:**
- Revit family editing
- 3D modeling and rendering
- Architectural visualization

## ⏱️ Project 2: 4D Simulation Project

**Objective:**  
Integrate 3D BIM data with project schedules to visualize the construction sequence over time using Navisworks.

**Highlights:**
- Linking Gantt chart activities from MS Project or Primavera to Revit components
- Creating animations of construction stages
- Timeline-based simulation of foundation, framing, electrical, and roofing stages

**Skills Used:**
- 4D simulation in Navisworks Manage
- TimeLiner tool
- Project scheduling integration

## 🧱 Project 3: Constructability Review & Clash Detection

**Objective:**  
Perform a constructability review and detect design clashes between disciplines.

**Highlights:**
- Coordination of architectural, structural, and MEP models
- Clash detection using Navisworks
- Reports of detected issues (e.g., duct passing through beam)

**Skills Used:**
- Clash detection using Clash Detective in Navisworks
- Model coordination
- Constructability analysis

## 📌 How to Use

1. Open individual folders to explore project files.
2. Use Autodesk Revit to view `.rvt` files and make design edits.
3. Open `.nwd` or `.nwf` files in Navisworks to simulate and detect clashes.
4. Refer to exported PDF reports and screenshots for analysis results.
